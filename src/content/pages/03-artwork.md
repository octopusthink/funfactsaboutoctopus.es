Octopuses are curious and intelligent. Combined with having a basically liquid body and an extraordinary number of arms, this means they get into trouble a lot when they live in aquariums. Keepers need to make sure they're entertained so they don't sneak out to snack on crabs in the next tank or plug a filter and flood the whole room.
