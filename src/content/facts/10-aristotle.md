"The octopus is a stupid creature, for it will approach a man’s hand if it be lowered in the water."

Like many science-y things (see: men going bald because they use their brains more than women) Aristotle was wrong on this one. Nowadays, we know that octopuses actually hang out with humans because they're curious and interested in what we're up to—even when what we're up to is undermining their intellect.
