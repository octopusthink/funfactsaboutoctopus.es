"The octopus is a stupid creature, for it will approach a man’s hand if it be lowered in the water."

As with many science-y things (see: "natural" slavery, women's inferiority, hair growth being dependent on moisture like hair is some kind of plant you wear on your head), Aristotle was wrong on this one.

Nowadays, we know that octopuses actually hang out with humans because they're curious and interested in what we're up to—even when what we're up to is undermining their intellect.
