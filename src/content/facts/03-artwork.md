Octopuses are curious and intelligent. This isn't always a good thing when you have eight arms and a super-flexible body. Octopuses in captivity tend to flood labs, disassemble expensive equipment, and generally cause mayhem.

Caretakers tend to look for ways to keep their octopuses distracted. An octopus named Squirt used a series of remote brushes, set up by his aquarist, to paint on canvases. Squirt has since retired, but [Fiona](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/article224561580.html), [Rocky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVqIVx2jt4k), and [Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gg733eRIeM) follow in his footsteps.
