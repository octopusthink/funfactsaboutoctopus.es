Pierre Denys de Montfort was a French naturalist who had something of an obsession with giant octopuses. And you know how, when you think about something a whole lot, you start seeing it everywhere? Yep, that's what happened here.

de Montfort told everyone they'd sunk a group of warships that mysteriously disappeared one night in 1782. Turns out the disappearance was less of a mystery than originally proposed and he was summarily discredited. His career tanked (probably attacked by a giant octopus), and he died destitute.
