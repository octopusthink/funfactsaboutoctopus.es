Do cephalopods dream? Scientists aren't sure, but there's some evidence indicating that they experience a phase of sleep similar to REM sleep in humans. Sleeping octopuses actually flicker, changing colours and patterns like some kind of multi-armed lava lamp. 

These colour and pattern changes are similar to the way that octopuses use colour changes to camoflague themselves whilst awake. This has led scientists to theorise that octopuses may be dreaming about eating tasty crab or running away from a shark.

We'll probably never know what they're dreaming about, but it sure is pretty to watch.
