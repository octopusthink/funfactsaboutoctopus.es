Do cephalopods dream? Scientists aren't sure, but there's some evidence indicating that they experience a phase of sleep similar to REM sleep in humans. Sleeping octopuses actually flicker, changing colours and patterns like a multi-armed lava lamp. 

These colour and pattern changes are similar to the way that octopuses camoflague themselves whilst awake, leading scientists to theorise that octopuses may be dreaming about eating tasty crab. (Or running away from a shark!)

We'll probably never know what they're dreaming about, but it sure is pretty to watch.
