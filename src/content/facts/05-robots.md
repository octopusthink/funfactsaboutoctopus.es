Octopuses are kind of weird, so they're of particular interest to researchers. Most robots are still, awkward creatures, but the robots modelled after octopuses are soft and flexible.

Soft robots can do all sorts of things that your typical boxy robot can'tâ€”like navigate bumpy irregular surfaces, work as a health aides, or even conduct surgery inside people. Thanks to the octopus, soft robotics is now a growing industry.
