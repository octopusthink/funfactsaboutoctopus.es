Octopuses are technically colourblind, but they're master camouflage artists who can turn all sorts of different colours and patterns to match their surroundings. How do they do this if they can't perceive colour?

It turns out, they have the same opsins (pigment proteins) used in their eyes in their skin. This allows octopuses to respond to light and effectively see what's nearby.
