One heart is for pumping blood to the body, and the other two are for the gills.

In spite of this surplus of hearts, octopuses are solitary creatures who donâ€™t tend to make friends. They're more likely to _eat_ another octopus than invite them to dinner.

They also have more brains than we do, but that's a story for later.
