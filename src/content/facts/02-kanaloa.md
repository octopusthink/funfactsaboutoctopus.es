Kanaloa is one of the four major akua (gods) of traditional Hawaiian religion and ruler of the underworld.

He led the spirits in a rebellion in which the spirits were defeated by the gods and as punishment were thrown in the Underworld.

One translation of the Hawaiian creation myth the Kumulipo suggests that the octopus is the lone survivor of a previous age.
