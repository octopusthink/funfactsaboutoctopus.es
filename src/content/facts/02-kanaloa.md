Kanaloa is one of the four major _akua_ (gods) of traditional Hawaiian religion and ruler of the underworld. For leading the spirits in a failed rebellion, he was cast into the underworld. He did seem to get installed as a god, so it seems like something of a lateral move.

Depending on how you translate the _Kumulipo_, the Hawaiian creation myth, Kanaloa is basically the last alien survivor of a now-extinct age.
