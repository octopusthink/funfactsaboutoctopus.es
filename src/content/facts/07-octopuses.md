Apparently people have been arguing about this for at least 140 years.

The confusion arises because English just throws bits of other languages into a blender. "Octopus" came to English from the original Greek via a stay in Latin, and all three languages use different plural forms.

"Octopi" (Latin) is the _most_ wrong of the available options, and "octopodes" (Greek), whilst technically sort of correct, sounds pretentious. We use "octopuses" (English), the most commonly-used form, but we won't argue if you want to use something else.
