Technically, since "octopus" has Latin roots, not Greek, "octopi" is an incorrect pluralisation. "Octopuses" is correct, even if it _sounds_ wrong. "Octopodes" is also correct, although so archaic as to be basically incorrect.

So here's the deal: English is weird. Do what you want. We've opted for "octopuses," but we're not going to jump down your beak if you want to call them something else.
