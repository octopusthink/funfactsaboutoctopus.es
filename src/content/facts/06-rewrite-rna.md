File this under "weird skills 101": octopuses are able to edit their own RNA on the fly, effectively implementing genetic changes to adapt to their environment _without_ undergoing any genetic mutations.

Most creatures rely on DNA mutations to adapt, meaning these changes take generations to take effect. Octopuses, on the other hand, are continually altering their own genetic information, especially in the areas of their brains. Maybe that's why they're so smart? Should we be worried about the impending octopus revolution?
