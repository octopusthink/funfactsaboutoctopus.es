Human blood is red because our blood contains the iron-based hemoglobin, a protein containing iron that binds to oxygen and transports it throughout our bloodstreams. Octopus blood contains a similar protein called hemocyanin, which contains copper instead of iron.

Copper is a better oxygen transporter when the water temperature is low and there isn't much oxygen. Since octopuses live all over the world, this allows them to deal with all sorts of extremes of temperature without having a panic attack.
