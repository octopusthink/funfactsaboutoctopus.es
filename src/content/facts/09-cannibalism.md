Octopus sex, as you might anticipate from a creature with so many arms, is a bit of an odd proposition. For males, it's also quite a dangerous one.

Since female octopuses are often larger—and most octopuses are decidedly anti-social—there's always a chance that his lady partner will get bored and/or hungry mid-coitus, switching gears from "romance" to "having a delightful octopus snack."

Isn't that always the way?
