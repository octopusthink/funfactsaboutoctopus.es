Our 2019 [World Octopus Day](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/world-octopus-day/) project: celebrating the awesomeness of our favourite ocean friend.

## Facts about facts

We add a new fact every month, generally on or around the 8th. If you have a fact you'd like to see here, feel free to open an issue or a pull request to discuss!
