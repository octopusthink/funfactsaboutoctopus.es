# [funfactsaboutoctopus.es](https://funfactsaboutoctopus.es/)

For [World Octopus Day](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/world-octopus-day/) 2019, [we](https://octopusthink.com/) put together a little micro-site to celebrate the awesomeness of our favourite ocean friend. Updated once a month (usually), on the 8th (or thereabouts), until we run out of facts. Octopuses are super weird, so it might take a while.

## Development

### Getting started

funfactsaboutoctopus.es uses Gatsby. To run a local copy, clone the repo to your local machine, and start the Gatsby server:

```bash
npm start
```

That's it! You can now find the site at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

All changes you make to front-end React code and styles will immediately be loaded. Any changes to `gatbsy-config.js` or `gatsby-node.js` require restarting the Gatsby server.

### Using the design system

funfactsaboutoctopus.es uses the [Nautilus](https://nautilus.octopusthink.com) design system under the hood. Since Nautilus is still very much under development, it's pulling from the latest changes made to the `master` GitHub branch, rather than the published version.

To pull the latest changes, uninstall and reinstall the Nautilus dependency:

```bash
npm uninstall nautilus && npm install --save octopusthink/nautilus
```

## Facts about facts

We add a new fact every month, generally on or around the 8th. If you have a fact you'd like to see here, feel free to open an issue or a pull request to discuss!
